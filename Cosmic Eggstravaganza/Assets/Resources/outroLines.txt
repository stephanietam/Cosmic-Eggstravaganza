After many days of hard work, you finally saved up enough money for a new spaceship that can take you home.
You head over to man's store and greet him.
"You've done well to make it this far. Congratulations on earning enough to buy a new ship."
You hand him your stars and he shakes your hand before handing over a key and some documents for your new ship. After exchanging farewells, you turn to leave the store.
"Wait..."
You pause and look back at the man.
"Did you ever wonder what happened to the creatures you raised? Who were you selling them to? What are they doing now?"
You feel a cold sweat building up on your forehead as the man continues.
"Don't you think it was just a bit too convenient for you to crash land on an asteroid and immediately have a way to earn your way back?"
"Well... maybe it isn't worth thinking about any further..."
The man smiles at you, but you don't feel any warmth in his smile.
"Good luck on your way back. And stay safe."
You leave the store and head back to your farm where your new ship is waiting for departure. With all of the buildings empty and the creatures gone, you feel a bit lonely.
With one last glance at your farm, you make your way toward the spaceship.
THE END
Thank you for playing!
