After many days of hard work, you finally saved up enough money for a new spaceship that can take you home.
Although you had no choice but to start raising and selling creatures, it wasn't a bad experience. The creatures were unlike anything on Earth, and raising them reminded you of why you embarked on your interstellar adventure- to see new things and learn more about the world.
Now that you have the means to leave, it's time for you to set off on your next journey.
With one last glance at your farm, you make your way toward the spaceship.
