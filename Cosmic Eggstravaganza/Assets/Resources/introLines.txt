Hey, wake up!
Hesitantly, you look up, expecting some kind of alien, to see another human. You shuffle up quickly to look for your ship and see it, unrecognizable, in the dust behind you.
I saw your ship crash. You've been out for a few minutes. You okay?
Upon seeing your spaceship, your tears involuntarily well up.
After decades with your treasured ship, you finally have to find a replacement. You can tell from looking around that there's no ship you can buy here on par with your old one. You'll have to find a way home, but how?
The kind stranger brings you back to his shop nearby. Most of his shelves hold baskets of giant eggs, about ten times the size of those back home on Earth. And most of the others have huge bags of strange blue pebbles. The rest of his displays are stocked with strange bottles, random items, and rocks. After talking with the kind stranger for a while, it all finally made sense.
There's a bunch of buildings on the West side of the asteroid where a small community was supposed to be built. Tomorrow, we can repurpose those into various building for the creatures to use and raise them. I'll give you this old creature, its egg, and a few bags of feed to start off, but tonight you should just rest.
