Tick…Tick…Creaaaaaak…Sssss......POP! Your fuel tank has ruptured. Your recreational starship, The Airstream 113, is plummeting down unsteadily toward strange, rocky land- what seems to be the surface of an asteroid. Expecting the impact, you hide for cover and hope for the best.
…
“Hey, wake up!” …
Expecting some kind of alien, you look up hesitantly to see another human.  “I saw your ship crash. You’ve been out for a few minutes. You okay?”
Still, in shock, you turn, looking for your treasured spaceship, to find it unrecognizably wrecked in the dust. You can tell from looking around that there’s no ship you can buy here on par with your old one. You’ll have to find a way home before continuing your interstellar adventure, but how?
The kind stranger brings you back to his shop, its shelves holding baskets of giant eggs, ten times the size of those back on Earth, strange bottles, random items, and huge bags of strange blue pebbles. After talking with him for a while, it finally made sense. 
“Look, there’s a bunch of buildings on the West side of the asteroid where a new community was supposed to be built. Tomorrow, we can repurpose those into buildings to raise the creatures in. I’ll give you this egg and some feed to start off, but tonight you should just rest. Raise and sell enough of these guys, and you’ll get enough money to buy a ticket home in no time.”
